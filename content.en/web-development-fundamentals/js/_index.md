Equip learners with a foundational understanding of JavaScript to add dynamic behavior and interactive elements to their websites.

>**JavaScript (JS)** is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive content on web pages. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside **HTML** and **CSS**, and is supported by all modern web browsers.

1. **Client-Side Scripting**  
   - Runs directly in the browser to create interactive and dynamic web experiences, such as form validation, animations, and interactive maps.

2. **Versatile and Cross-Platform**  
   - JavaScript is platform-independent and works across operating systems and devices.

3. **Event-Driven**  
   - JavaScript reacts to user actions (e.g., clicks, typing) and browser events (e.g., loading a page).

4. **Interpreted Language**  
   - Executes line-by-line in the browser without the need for compilation.

5. **Integration with HTML and CSS**  
   - Works seamlessly with HTML and CSS to provide functionality and styling to websites.

6. **Server-Side Capability**  
   - With tools like **Node.js**, JavaScript can also be used on servers, making it a full-stack development language.

### **Why Use JavaScript?**
- To create interactive web pages.
- To add dynamic behavior like live updates, sliders, and modal windows.
- To build web and mobile applications using frameworks like **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js**.
- To enable real-time communication in applications like chat apps using WebSockets.
- To develop server-side applications with **Node.js**.

### **How JavaScript Works**
JavaScript runs in a browser's JavaScript engine, such as:
- **Google Chrome**: V8 Engine
- **Firefox**: SpiderMonkey
- **Safari**: JavaScriptCore
- **Edge**: Chakra (or V8 in Chromium-based Edge)

When a web page loads, the browser interprets and executes the JavaScript code to add interactivity.
