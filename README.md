# Web Essentials

This module introduces the **foundational concepts of web development**, covering the **structure, style, and behavior** of websites. Learners will gain hands-on experience in building their **first static website** through a series of guided exercises.

## Goals

1. **Use Emmet Syntax** ‚Äì All HTML code snippets will be provided in _Emmet_ format for faster learning and practice.
2. **Practical Use Cases** ‚Äì Each concept will be demonstrated through examples that closely resemble real-world lab expectations.
3. **Step-by-Step Learning** ‚Äì Full copy-paste samples will not be provided. Instead, learners will build incrementally through **progressive snippets**.

## Setup

Clone the repository to get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/csebooks/web-essentials.git
cd web-essentials
```

Open the project folder in your preferred IDE (for example, **Visual Studio Code**).

## Preview

Ensure you have [Node.js installed](https://github.com/csebooks/web-essentials/blob/main/content.en/web-development-fundamentals/_index.md).
You can verify the installation with:

```sh
node -v
```

Install dependencies and start the server:

```sh
npm install
npm start
