Teach the basics of HTML, enabling learners to structure content logically and semantically for websites.

> **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and design the structure of web pages. It defines the content and layout of a web page using a system of tags and attributes. HTML is the backbone of all websites and is used in conjunction with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity).

1. **Markup Language**  
   - HTML uses tags to annotate (or "mark up") text and other elements to define their structure and function in a web page.

2. **Static Content**  
   - HTML is primarily used to create the static structure of a web page, like text, images, and links.

3. **Hypertext**  
   - The term "HyperText" refers to the ability to link to other web pages using hyperlinks.

4. **Platform-Independent**  
   - HTML files can be viewed on any device or operating system using a web browser.

5. **Extensible with Other Technologies**  
   - Works seamlessly with CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding dynamic behavior to web pages.
